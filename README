NAME

File::ContentStore - A store for file content built with hard links

SYNOPSIS

    use File::ContentStore;

    # the 'path' argument is expected to exist
    my $store = File::ContentStore->new( path => "$ENV{HOME}/.photo_content" );
    $store->link_dir( @collection_of_photo_directories );

DESCRIPTION

This module manages a "content store" as a collection of hard links to a set
of files. The files in the content store are named after the digest of the
content in the file.

When linking a new file to the content store, a hard link is created to
the file, named after the digest of the content. When a file which content
is already in the store is linked in, the file is hard linked to the
content file in the store.
